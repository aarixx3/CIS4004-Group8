# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

## Expanding the ESLint configuration

If you are developing a production application, we recommend using TypeScript and enable type-aware lint rules. Check out the [TS template](https://github.com/vitejs/vite/tree/main/packages/create-vite/template-react-ts) to integrate TypeScript and [`typescript-eslint`](https://typescript-eslint.io) in your project.


### Web App

üíß **Hydration Tracker Web Application**
A user-friendly hydration tracker that helps individuals monitor and reach their daily water intake goals. Designed with accessibility, reminders, and simple visual feedback to promote healthier hydration habits.

üîç **How It Works**
Sign Up / Log In: Users authenticate securely using Supabase.

Set Daily Goal: Users define how much water they want to drink each day.

Track Intake: Add water intake manually throughout the day.

Progress View: A visual progress bar shows how close you are to your goal.

Reminders: Browser notifications remind users to stay hydrated.

Data Storage: All data is saved in Supabase and persists across sessions.

‚ú® **Features**
üîí Authentication via Supabase (Sign Up / Log In / Log Out)

üìä Progress Tracking with daily reset

üîî Hydration Reminders via browser notifications

üì± Responsive Design for mobile and desktop

‚òÅÔ∏è Persistent Data Storage using Supabase database

üé® Simple & Clean UI with focus on user accessibility

üöÄ **Deployment Instructions**

**Prerequisites**
-Node.js (v18 or later)
-npm or yarn
-Supabase project (for backend data storage and authentication)
-.env file for Supabase keys and config

üõ† **Supabase Setup**
To get the backend working with Supabase, the following steps were taken:
1. Create a Supabase Project
-Go to app.supabase.com and create a new project.
-Save the Project URL and Anon Public API Key.
2. Define the Database Schema
-Created a hydration_logs table with the following fields:

sql
CREATE TABLE hydration_logs (
  id uuid PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
  user_id uuid REFERENCES auth.users ON DELETE CASCADE,
  date date NOT NULL,
  amount_ml integer NOT NULL,
  created_at timestamptz DEFAULT now()
);
3. Create Indexes

Optimized queries with these indexes:

sql
CREATE INDEX idx_user_date ON hydration_logs(user_id, date);
4. Set Row-Level Security (RLS) Policies
-Enabled RLS on the hydration_logs table:

ALTER TABLE hydration_logs ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
Added policy to allow authenticated users to insert and view only their own data:

CREATE POLICY "Users can access their own hydration logs"
ON hydration_logs
FOR SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE
USING (auth.uid() = user_id);
Authentication

Used Supabase Auth (email/password) to manage signups and logins.

Integrated @supabase/supabase-js client SDK on the frontend.

**Steps to Deploy**

1. Clone the Repository
bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/hydration-tracker.git
cd hydration-tracker

2.Install Dependencies
bash

PORT=3000

4. Run the App locally
bash
npm run dev
Access the App Open your browser and navigate to: http://localhost:3000
